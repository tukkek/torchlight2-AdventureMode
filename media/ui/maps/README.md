# Map icon workflow

1. Edit `maps.xcf` with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).
2. When ready to export, Save File then Flatten Image (Image menu) and export as `maps.dds`.
3. Close without saving or Undo History (Edit menu) to keep a copy of the layered source file. 

# To-do

1. Expand for Bosses using `map_dragon` as base.
2. Expand for non-Map Dungeons using `map_cave` as base.
3. Expand for Outdoors using `map_icecave` as base (probably)?
