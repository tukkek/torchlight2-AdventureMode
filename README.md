**Adventure mode** overhauls Torchlight II's map system by transforming the campaign areas and end-game maps into tiered, scaling content from level 1 to 100. Unlike other mods, it organizes maps into 16 different tiers so that players experience a well-structured sense of progression rather than simply making every scroll in the game scale to the player's level - instead, you can push your build to the limit by travelling to higher-tier maps or make your own pace casually and grind lower-level maps until you're ready to advance to the next step of your journey!

Maps can be purchased from vendors as soon as you reach the Estherian Enclave (first town hub and second overall area in the game). These scrolls don't require you to unlock or access the Mapworks, simply right-clicking them from your inventory screen will immediately open a portal you can travel through.

# Main features

# Gameplay details

As with most roguelike games, you can be dealt a rougher hand early on due to the randomness, when your character is at its weakest. If you have any trouble, try sticking to Tier 1 maps until you have at least a full set of gear from the blacksmith. Also, consider trying this on Casual difficulty at first while you're still learning how this mode's progression works.

The first and last tier of map scrolls have some limited scaling, with Tier 1 scaling with player level up to level 5 and Tier 16 likewise from level 80 to 100. This is done both to ease lower-level characters into the progression system (especially important on higher difficulties) and to provide an "endgame" for players who want to push to level 100.

Since you can't find any spell vendors in this mode, a guaranteed spell drop is given with every boss and gold chest. This shouldn't impact balance too much as most spells are tuned around their mana cost and there is a hard limit to the number of spells you can have at once (even if you only go for passives). It also gives a nice incentive (and reward) to investing more time into longer dungeon and higher-risk boss maps. As a fall-back, champion monsters also have a small chance of dropping spells.
